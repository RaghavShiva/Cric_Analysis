# Cricket Analysis Project: Building the Perfect Playing Eleven

## Introduction
Welcome to my Cricket Analysis Project! üèè  
This project is a blend of my passion for cricket and my love for numbers. It analyzes data from a T20I tournament that took place two years ago to build the ultimate playing eleven based on specific rules and player roles. Eventually, I plan to update this project with **real-time data** for a more dynamic analysis.

## Key Features
- **Player Categorization**: The players are divided into various categories such as:
  - Openers
  - Anchors
  - Lower Order
  - All-rounders
  - Pacers
- **Data Visualization**: The project visualizes player stats and insights using **Power BI** for better graphical representation.
- **Data Collection**: Utilizes **Bright Data** and JavaScript scraping for efficient data collection.
- **Additional Stats**: New statistics are added to enhance player role analysis.

## Setup

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites:
- **Node.js** and **npm** (Node Package Manager) should be installed.
- **Power BI** (for data visualization).
- **Bright Data** for web scraping.

## Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RaghavShiva/Cric_Analysis
```

## Screenshots

Here are some screenshots showing how the player roles are analyzed and displayed in the project:

- **Openers Analysis**: Screenshot showing top-performing openers based on stats.
- **Anchors Analysis**: Visual representation of anchor player performance.
- **Lower Order and All-rounders**: Insights and stats of the lower-order batsmen and all-rounders.
  
These screenshots can be found in the `img/` folder of the repository.

## Future Improvements
- Integration of **real-time data** for dynamic and up-to-date analysis.
- Further enhancements in **data visualization** for better insights.
- Collaboration and suggestions are welcome to take the project to the next level.
